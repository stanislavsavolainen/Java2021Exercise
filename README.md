To use maven project install maven and configure enviroment variable. Then run "mvn package" for building project or just for test "mvn test". You can find App.jar file in target-folder, run command : "java -jar App.jar" to launch application via console.

This maven project works for linux and windows, just modify OutputDataService.java and PersonServices.java for linux/windows filesystem. Make sure that PersonServices.java can find project files like : bankaccount.json, person.json and systemlog.txt.

"target-folder" is not mandatory when copy project, because it apears when you call "mvn package"
